    "BAD Molecule Filter is a Flask Web Application for a machine learning model that predicts properties of molecules based on their chemical structure. Here is an overview of the key components and functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. calculating similarity thresholds and labeling predictions based on applicability domain analysis\n",
    "2. The application supports different models (IM, CM, MM) and processes input molecules accordingly.\n",
    "3. The application includes routes for interacting with the model through a web interface, either by entering a single SMILES string or uploading a file containing multiple SMILES strings.\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Activate Virtual Environment (if applicable) \n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Step 2: Installcd Required Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "pip install flask werkzeug numpy pandas rdkit mordred scikit-learn pyADA`\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Step 3: Freeze Dependencies to requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "pip freeze > requirements.txt`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a requirements.txt file with the versions of the installed packages. Now, the file should contain lines similar to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Flask==1.1.2\n",
    "Werkzeug==1.0.1\n",
    "numpy==1.20.2\n",
    "pandas==1.2.3\n",
    "rdkit==2021.03.5\n",
    "mordred==1.2.0\n",
    "scikit-learn==0.24.1\n",
    "pyADA==0.5.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Optional - Edit requirements.txt\n",
    "You may want to edit the requirements.txt file if you need specific versions or if you want to remove unnecessary dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Install from requirements.txt\n",
    "To install these dependencies in another environment, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install the specified versions of the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Make sure to adjust the file paths and virtual environment activation command according to your specific setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps for running your Flask application in both development and production modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Application\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "Activate Virtual Environment (if applicable):\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run Flask in Development Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "export FLASK_APP=app\n",
    "export FLASK_ENV=development\n",
    "flask run\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The FLASK_APP environment variable is set to the name of Flask application (without the \".py\" extension).\n",
    "Note: The FLASK_ENV environment variable is set to \"development\" to enable debug mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access the Application:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a web browser and go to **http://127.0.0.1:5000/** to access your Flask application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stop the Development Server:\n",
    "Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the Flask application is running to stop the development server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install Production Web Server (e.g., gunicorn):\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "pip install gunicorn`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run Flask with Gunicorn:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app`\n",
    "```\n",
    "-w 4 specifies the number of worker processes. Adjust it based on your server's capabilities.\n",
    "-b 0.0.0.0:8000 binds Gunicorn to all public IPs on port 8000.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access the Application:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a web browser and go to http://your-server-ip:8000/ to access your Flask application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stop Gunicorn:\n",
    "\n",
    "To stop Gunicorn, you can find its process ID using tools like ps or pgrep and then use kill to stop the process in Linux/Unix/OSX or through task manager Ctrl+Alt+Del in Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "ps aux | grep gunicorn\n",
    "kill -9 <process_id>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: Ensure to replace **/path/to/your/venv** with the actual path to your virtual environment, and adjust the server configuration (e.g., number of workers) based on your deployment requirements.\n",
