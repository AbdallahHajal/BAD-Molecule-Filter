# Accurate Aggregates Predictor

## Brief Description
The Accurate Aggregates Predictor is a specialized machine learning tool crafted to revolutionize the field of drug discovery. It achieves this by accurately identifying Small Colloidally Aggregating Molecules (SCAMs). Through the adoption of advanced Decision Tree Ensemble Methods, this tool significantly improves the precision of SCAM detection. Our approach is characterized by the integration of three distinct modeling strategies - individual, consensus, and collective - each designed to meet specific needs. This tool is instrumental in enhancing the efficiency of hit rate optimization and substantially reduces the time and resources required for testing and validation in the crucial early stages of drug discovery.
